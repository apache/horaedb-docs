We very much welcome contributions from the community.
To make the process easier and more valuable for everyone involved we have a few rules and guidelines to follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="submitting-issues-and-feature-requests">Submitting Issues and Feature Requests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you file an &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/horaedb/issues/new">issue&lt;/a>, please search existing issues in case the same or similar issues have already been filed.
If you find an existing open ticket covering your issue then please avoid adding &amp;ldquo;👍&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;me too&amp;rdquo; comments; GitHub notifications can cause a lot of noise for the project maintainers who triage the back-log.
However, if you have a new piece of information for an existing ticket, and you think it may help the investigation or resolution, then please do add it as a comment!
You can signal to the team that you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing an existing issue with one of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s emoji reactions (these are a good way to add &amp;ldquo;weight&amp;rdquo; to an issue from a prioritisation perspective).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
