# Cluster Deployment

In the [Quick Start](../quick_start.md) section, we have introduced the deployment of single CeresDB instance.

Besides, as a distributed timeseries database, multiple CeresDB instances can be deployed as a cluster to serve with high availability and scalability.

Currently, work about the integration with kubernetes is still in process, so CeresDB cluster can only be deployed manually. And there are two modes of cluster deployment:

- [NoMeta Mode(Only for testing)](no_meta.md)
- [WithMeta Mode](with_meta.md)
