# Observability

CeresDB is observable with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) is a systems and service monitoring system.

### Configuration

Save the following configuration into the `prometheus.yml` file. For example, in the `tmp` directory, `/tmp/prometheus.yml`.

Two CeresDB http service are started on localhost:5440 and localhost:5441.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: ceresdb-server
    static_configs:
      - targets: [your_ip:5440, your_ip:5441]
        labels:
          env: ceresdbcluster
```

See details about configuration [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

### Run

You can use docker to start Prometheus. The docker image information is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus).

```
docker run \
    -d --name=prometheus \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus:v2.41.0
```

For more detailed installation methods, refer to [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/).

## Grafana

[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) is an open and composable observability and data visualization platform.

### Run

You can use docker to start grafana. The docker image information is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana).

```
docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:9.3.6
```

Default admin user credentials are admin/admin.

Grafana is available on http://127.0.0.1:3000.

For more detailed installation methods, refer to [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/).
